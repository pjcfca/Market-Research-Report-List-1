<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Performance Muffler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorptive Mufflers</li><li>Reactive Mufflers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absorptive mufflers use sound-absorbing materials such as fiberglass or foam to reduce noise levels by absorbing sound waves. These mufflers work by converting sound energy into heat energy, reducing the intensity of noise. On the other hand, reactive mufflers use baffles, tubes, and chambers to reflect sound waves and interfere with their progress, canceling out noise. Both types of performance mufflers are designed to enhance exhaust flow and improve engine performance while reducing noise levels in vehicles.</p></p>
