<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antisense and RNA Interference Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>RNA</li><li>Antisense RNA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RNA therapeutics are a type of treatment involving the use of RNA molecules to target and treat diseases at the genetic level. Two major types of RNA therapeutics are antisense RNA and RNA interference (RNAi). Antisense RNA works by binding to complementary RNA strands, preventing them from being used to make proteins. RNAi, on the other hand, uses small RNA molecules to silence specific genes. Both approaches show promise in treating various diseases by modulating gene expression and protein production to restore normal cellular functions.</p></p>
