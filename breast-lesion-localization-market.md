<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breast Lesion Localization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wire</li><li>Radioisotope</li><li>Magnetic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breast lesion localization is a procedure used to precisely locate suspicious lesions in the breast prior to surgery. There are three types of localization methods available in the market: wire, radioisotope, and magnetic. </p><p>Wire localization involves inserting a thin wire into the breast to guide the surgeon to the exact location of the lesion. Radioisotope localization uses a small amount of radioactive material injected near the lesion, which is then detected using a special probe during surgery. Magnetic localization employs magnetic seeds or markers that are placed near the lesion and can be detected by a magnetic probe during surgery.</p></p>
