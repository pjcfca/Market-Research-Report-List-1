<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Postemergence Herbicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid-based</li><li>Salt-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Postemergence herbicides can be classified into two main types based on their chemical composition - acid-based and salt-based herbicides. Acid-based herbicides work by disrupting plant cell walls and membranes, leading to desiccation and ultimately plant death. On the other hand, salt-based herbicides work by interfering with plant metabolic processes, inhibiting growth and leading to plant death. Both types of herbicides are commonly used in agriculture to control weeds that have already emerged.</p></p>
