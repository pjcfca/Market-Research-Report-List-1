<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Farm Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias-ply Tires</li><li>Radial-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Farm tractor tires come in two main types: bias-ply tires and radial-ply tires. Bias-ply tires are constructed with plies that run at a diagonal angle across the tire, providing good traction in soft or muddy conditions. Radial-ply tires have plies that run at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, offering a smoother ride and improved fuel efficiency on hard surfaces. Both types have their own advantages depending on the specific needs of the farmer or agricultural operation.</p></p>
