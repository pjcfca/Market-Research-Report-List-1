<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electron Beam Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Electron Beam Resists</li><li>Negative Electron Beam Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electron beam resists are used in the fabrication of electronic devices through electron beam lithography. There are two main types of electron beam resists: positive and negative. Positive electron beam resists become more soluble when exposed to the electron beam, allowing for the removal of the exposed areas during development. Negative electron beam resists become less soluble when exposed to the electron beam, creating a hardened pattern on the substrate. Both types play a crucial role in the manufacturing of high-resolution electronic devices.</p></p>
