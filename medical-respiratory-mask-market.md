<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Respiratory Mask Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Air Respirator</li><li>Long Tube Respirator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical respiratory mask market includes two main types of masks: positive pressure air respirators and long tube respirators. Positive pressure air respirators supply a constant flow of filtered air to the wearer, creating a positive pressure within the mask to prevent any contaminated air from entering. On the other hand, long tube respirators use a hose connected to a clean air source, allowing the wearer to move freely while still receiving a constant supply of clean air. These two types of masks are designed to provide respiratory protection in medical environments.</p></p>
