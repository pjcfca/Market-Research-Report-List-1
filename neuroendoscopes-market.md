<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuroendoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Neuroendoscope</li><li>Flexible Neuroendoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuroendoscopes are medical devices used for minimally invasive procedures in the brain. Rigid neuroendoscopes are straight, have a fixed shape, and provide high-quality imaging, making them suitable for precise interventions. Flexible neuroendoscopes, on the other hand, have a bendable shaft that allows for navigation through complex anatomical structures, providing flexibility and greater accessibility during procedures. Both types play a crucial role in neurosurgery, offering different features and benefits to healthcare professionals depending on the specific requirements of the procedure.</p></p>
