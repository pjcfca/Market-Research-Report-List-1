<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Drum Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Braking</li><li>Automatic Self-adjustment</li><li>Emergency Braking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Normal Braking refers to the standard operation of drum brakes when the driver applies pressure to the brake pedal for regular slowing or stopping of the vehicle. Automatic Self-adjustment involves a mechanism within the drum brake system that automatically adjusts the brake shoes as they wear down, ensuring consistent and optimal braking performance. Emergency Braking is a feature that provides additional braking force when the driver performs a sudden and forceful brake application, helping to quickly bring the vehicle to a stop in emergency situations.</p></p>
