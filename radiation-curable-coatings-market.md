<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation-Curable Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultraviolet Curing</li><li>Electron Beam Curing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation-curable coatings are a type of coating that can rapidly cure and harden when exposed to specific forms of radiation. Ultraviolet (UV) curing involves using UV rays to initiate a chemical reaction that leads to coating hardening. This type of coating is commonly used in industries like automotive, electronics, and printing. On the other hand, electron beam curing involves using high-energy electrons to achieve the same curing effect. This method is particularly advantageous for coatings that are thick or require a deeper penetration. Both UV and electron beam curing offer quick curing times, high film build, and environmentally friendly characteristics.</p></p>
