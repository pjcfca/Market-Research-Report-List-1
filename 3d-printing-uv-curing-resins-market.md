<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Printing UV-curing Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free Radical Type</li><li>Cationic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>3D Printing UV-curing resins are divided into two main types: Free Radical Type and Cationic Type. Free Radical Type resins use a photoinitiator that generates free radicals upon exposure to UV light, which then initiate polymerization. On the other hand, Cationic Type resins use a photoinitiator that generates cations upon exposure to UV light, which then initiate polymerization. Both types of resins are commonly used in various industries such as automotive, electronics, and healthcare for rapid prototyping and production of complex parts.</p></p>
