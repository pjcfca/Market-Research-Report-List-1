<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Dispersible Granule Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Water Dispersible Granule market can be categorized into two main types - Type I and Type II. Type I refers to granules that are easily dispersible in water and can form a smooth and stable suspension. These granules are commonly used in agriculture for pesticide and herbicide applications. On the other hand, Type II granules are less readily dispersible in water and may require additional mixing or agitation to achieve a uniform suspension. Type II granules are typically used in industries where a slower dispersion rate is acceptable.</p></p>
