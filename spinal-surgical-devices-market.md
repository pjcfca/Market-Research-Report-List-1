<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Surgical Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fusion Devices</li><li>Non-Fusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal surgical devices market consists of two types: fusion devices and non-fusion devices. Fusion devices are used to stabilize and fuse the vertebrae together, providing support and alleviating pain caused by conditions like degenerative disc disease. These devices can be internal fixation devices (such as screws, rods, and plates) or bone grafts. Non-fusion devices, on the other hand, are aimed at restoring the natural motion of the spine and include disc arthroplasty implants. These devices are used in surgeries where fusion may not be needed or desired.</p></p>
