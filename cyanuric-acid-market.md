<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyanuric Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Particle Cyanuric Acid</li><li>Powdered Cyanuric Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyanuric acid is a chemical compound commonly used in swimming pools to stabilize chlorine levels. The market for cyanuric acid can be divided into two main types: particle cyanuric acid and powdered cyanuric acid. Particle cyanuric acid is typically in granule form and dissolves more slowly, providing a longer-lasting effect. Powdered cyanuric acid, on the other hand, dissolves quickly and is more suited for immediate stabilization of chlorine levels. Both types of cyanuric acid play a crucial role in maintaining proper chlorine levels in swimming pools.</p></p>
