<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-PD-1 Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal</li><li>Polyclonal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-PD-1 Antibody market consists of two main types: Monoclonal and Polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by identical immune cells and are highly specific in targeting a single antigen. They are commonly used in research and clinical settings due to their consistent structure and potency. On the other hand, Polyclonal antibodies are derived from multiple immune cells and can target multiple epitopes on an antigen. They are often employed in diagnostics and immunotherapy due to their ability to recognize a wider range of antigens.</p></p>
