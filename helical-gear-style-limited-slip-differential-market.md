<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helical-gear Style Limited-slip Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical LSD</li><li>Electronic LSD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Helical-gear style limited-slip differentials are available in two main types - mechanical LSD and electronic LSD. Mechanical LSDs work based on the physical friction between gears, providing limited slip capabilities through mechanical means. On the other hand, electronic LSDs use sensors and actuators to control the differential's behavior, adjusting the slip of the wheels based on various factors. Both types aim to improve traction and handling by allowing the wheels to spin at different rates while maintaining power delivery and stability.</p></p>
