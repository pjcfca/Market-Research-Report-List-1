<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Multiple Units (EMU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Centralized</li><li>Power Decentralized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Multiple Units (EMU) are popular in two market types: Power Centralized and Power Decentralized. In a Power Centralized market, electricity is sourced from a central power station and distributed to multiple EMUs. This setup allows for efficient coordination of power usage and maintenance. In contrast, a Power Decentralized market involves each EMU being responsible for generating its own power, offering greater flexibility and independence. Both market types have their own advantages and cater to different operational needs in the transportation industry.</p></p>
